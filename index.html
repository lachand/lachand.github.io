Learning activities are increasingly breaking disciplinary boundaries, and unfold in a variety of contexts: in the classroom, at home, in libraries, etc. They are also increasingly digitally mediated. However most tools used are application-centric, structure documents and resources in silos, are designed for a given device and context of use. My research focuses on proposing activity-centric approach to facilitate the orchestration of learning activities inside and outside of the classroom.
